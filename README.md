# stencil

stencil is a templating engine designed by Andy VanWagoner ([thetalecrafter]) to enable templates to run in an environment with asynchrounous I/O, such as [node](http://nodejs.org).

## Features

  * Async nested templates.
  * Async function tags to ensure template is processed sequentially.

## Documentation

Read api documentation online at [github](http://thetalecrafter.github.com/stencil/docs/).

## Major TODOs

  * More detailed examples
  * Determine api direction (Hopefully with community input)
  * Write test cases
